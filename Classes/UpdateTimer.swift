/**
    A timer object for tracking commonly-needed time variables in the scene loop of a game.  Also includes a lap timer (see `lap()`) that makes it trivial to track
    an arbitrary event (i.e., one that isn't necessarily tied to the `update()` cycle).  During your scene loop's `update()` method, `timeSinceLastLap` will be
    set to the number of seconds since the previous time `lap()` was called (or, if it has never been called, the number of seconds since the first call to
    `update()`).  Call `lap()` any time the event you're monitoring occurs, and `timeSinceLastLap` will reset to 0 and begin counting up again.
